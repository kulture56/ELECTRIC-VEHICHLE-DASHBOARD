# 🚀 Power BI Dashboard for Electric Vehicles  

## 🔥 Overview  
This project showcases an interactive **Power BI dashboard** that analyzes **Electric Vehicle (EV) data** with clear storytelling and filtering capabilities. The dashboard allows users to explore different insights dynamically, adjusting filters to see real-time changes in data.  

## 📊 Key Features  
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Gain different insights by applying various filters to the dataset.  
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Visual storytelling using Power BI to highlight trends and key metrics.  
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Extract meaningful conclusions from EV data with clear visualizations.  

## 📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  
The dashboard focuses on the following KPIs:  

### 1️⃣ **Total Vehicles**  
- Assess the **total number of EVs**, including both **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)** and **Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)**.  
- Understand market size and growth trends.  

### 2️⃣ **Average Electric Range**  
- Determine the **average electric range** of EVs in the dataset.  
- Evaluate **technological advancements** and efficiency improvements over time.  

### 3️⃣ **Total BEV Vehicles & Market Share**  
- Identify and analyze the **total number of BEVs** in the dataset.  
- Calculate the **percentage of BEVs relative to all EVs** to track the adoption of fully electric models.
